# Claude Code Rules

## Commit Messages
- Keep commit messages simple and concise
- Do NOT use fancy formatting (no emojis, no markdown, no bullet points)
- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or any Claude attribution
- NEVER add "Generated with Claude Code" or similar footers
- Just write a plain, descriptive commit message
